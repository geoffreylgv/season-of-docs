My documentation skill is aimed at each digital user, providing them with the notch information. I believe that good documentation is as crucial as good code, and I'm committed to improving mine to help users and contributors get the most out of your project.
For the upcoming Season of Docs, I aim to measure the impact of our project by some KPIs such as time read, view, interaction ration, recommendation/share etc...
Your project has a strong foundation but recognize the need for enhanced documentation to reach its full potential. I'm committed to the open-source ethos and believe in the power of collaboration to create high-quality, accessible information for all.
